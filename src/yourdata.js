        abouttext: "I used to be a moderately successful musician, and now I am a moderately talented software developer. In need of a career change, I decided to follow through with a passion I had years ago. Obsessing over my Xanga page, or customizing the details of my MySpace was never something I thought could lead to a career. My passion for web development, and my drive for getting things done led me to the Case Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp. I am aware that full stack development cannot be mastered in six months, but the real value is the effort I put forth to confidently hone each skill. During my cohort I have developed dynamic applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, JSON, AJAX, NodeJS, apps using third-party APIs,  got really good at debugging, and all during the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic.   With continued learning, I look forward to working with passion, and integrity for a company whose values are aligned with my own.   ",
